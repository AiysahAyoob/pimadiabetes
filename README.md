The coursework involves a dataset, PimaDiabetes.csv, derived from one originally collected by
the USA’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases1. It lists various diagnostic
measures recorded from 750 women along with a 0/1 variable, Outcome, that indicates whether
the person eventually tested positive for diabetes. The diagnostic measures are explained below.

Pregnancies: number of times the woman has been pregnant

Glucose: plasma glucose concentration (mg/dl) at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Serum Insulin: insulin concentration2 (μ U/ml) at 2 hours in an OGTT

BMI: body mass index (weight in kg)/(height in m)2

Diabete Pedigree: a numerical score designed to measure the genetic influence of both the woman’s
diabetic and her non‑diabetic relatives on diabetes risk: higher scores mean higher risk. You
can read more about this in Smith, Everhart, Dickson, Knowler, and Johannes (1988).

Age: in years

Outcome: 1 if the woman eventually tested positive for diabetes, zero otherwise.
